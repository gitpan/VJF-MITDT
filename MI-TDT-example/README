trios.ped is a linkage file with missing data.
(colomns are : family, individual, father, mother, sex, phenotype, SNP1_1, SNP1_2, ...)

Use MI-TDT to generate 10 imputed files trios.ped.01 to trios.ped.10:

MI-TDT trios.ped

Then you can analyse these files separately. An example of analysis
with p-value recombination is given in the R script p-values.R
